A website for Chouc-le

Creating and designing a basic website with HTML/CSS to advertise a property abroad.
Intended to inform vistors about property and surrounding area, and forward interested parties to booking agent.

Hoping to initially build and explore with HTML/CSS and then potentially transition to Jekyll.
