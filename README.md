A website for Chouc-le

Creating and designing a basic, static website with HTML/CSS to advertise a property abroad.
Intended to inform vistors about property and surrounding area, and forward interested parties to booking agent.

Initially building and exploring with HTML/CSS and then hoping to establish a second, independent branch with Jekyll.
May transition between the two branches.
